Read Chapter 4.6 thru 5.2 (If you do not have a copy of the textbook yet, there is one on reserve at the library under "COMP000-STAFF - Permanent Reserve").

1.(2 pts) What are the differences between void functions and functions that return one value?
<div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

2.(3 pts) What happens if you forget the return statement in a void-function?
<div style="margin-bottom:12em"></div>

3.(3 pts) Can you define a function in the body of another function? And can you call a function in the body of another function?
  <div class="pagebreak"></div>

4.(10 pts) What is the output of the program below (write it in the space to the right)?

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void times(int y) {
  y = y * 9;
  cout << "y=" << y << endl;
}

int main() {
  int b = 7;
  times(b);
  cout << "b=" << b << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
</div>


5.(10 pts) Suppose we have a program where the main starts with the line:

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
  int main(int argc, char *argv[])  
```
</div>

  and the program is run with the following command line:

`~jimbo/cs16/myprog 12 dozen eggs`

What is the value of argc?
<div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>

What is the value of argv[2]
<div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>

What is the value of argv[1]
<div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>

What is the value of argv[0]
<div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>

What is the value of argv[1]/4?
<div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>

6.(12 pts) Take the example from question 5 above. Assume that "myprog" is supposed to take in the following arguments (in order): 2 integers, a double, and a string. Write a program that (a) checks if the number of arguments used is correct (otherwise, the program puts out an error message and quits) and (b) produces an output that is the string content followed by the sum of the two integers, divided by the double. For example, if the command is:
`./myprog 4 5 6.0 HumptyDumpty` ,then the output would be: `HumptyDumpty 1.5`
