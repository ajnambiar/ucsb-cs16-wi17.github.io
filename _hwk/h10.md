Read Chapter 5.4 thru 6.1. (If you do not have a copy of the textbook yet, there is one on reserve at the library under "COMP000-STAFF - Permanent Reserve"). 

<b>PLEASE MARK YOUR HOMEWORK CLEARLY, REGARDLESS OF IF YOU WRITE IT OUT IN INK OR PENCIL!<br/>
FOR BEST RESULTS, PRINT THIS PAGE AS A PDF, THEN PRINT THE PDF</b>

1. (6 pts) Why would a programmer use a driver program? What about a stub?
	<div style="margin-bottom:10em"></div>

2. (4 pts) What is the "Fundamental Rule for Testing Functions" actually telling us?
	<div style="margin-bottom:10em"></div>

3. (4 pts) When debugging a program, explain <i>why</i> randomly changing code is generally not a good idea.
  <div class="pagebreak"></div>
4.(2 pts) Show where you would insert an assert statement in this code in order to make sure that you would not get a run error:

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cassert>
using namespace std;

void foo(int x, int y) {
  y = 5 / x;
  cout << "Result = " << y << endl;
}

int main() {
  int a, b;
  cin >> a >> b;  
  foo(a, b);
  return 0;
}
```
</div>

5.(12 pts) What member functions do the following in C++11? Show the usual parameters/arguments, if any:

 Opens a file in ofstream classes:
 <div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>

 Opens a file in ifstream classes:
 <div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>

 Closes a file in ofstream classes:
 <div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>

 Checks to see if opening an input file failed in ifstream classes:
 <div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>

 Returns the position in the input file where you want to start reading in ifstream classes:
 <div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>

 Returns the position in the output sequence in ofstream classes:
 <div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>

6.(12pts) When users run the following program: (a) What do they see on their screen? and (b) What do they see in the file myData.txt?

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
int main () {
	using namespace std;
	ofstream out_stream;
	int x = 55, y =66;
	
	out_stream.open("myData.txt");
	for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
		out_stream << x << y << endl;
	out_stream.close();
	
	cout << "File is written";
	return 0;
}
```
