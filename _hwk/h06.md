Read Chapter 3.4 - 4.3 (If you do not have a copy of the textbook yet, there is one on reserve at the library under "COMP000-STAFF - Permanent Reserve").

<b>PLEASE MARK YOUR HOMEWORK CLEARLY, REGARDLESS OF IF YOU WRITE IT OUT IN INK OR PENCIL!</b>

<ol markdown="1">
1.	(2 pts) What is a flag in a program and of what use is it?
  <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

2.	(2 pts) What is variable tracing and how can it be of value to a programmer?
  <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

3.	(2 pts) In C++, how would you calculate the absolute value of the fraction -5/6?
  <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

4.	(2 pts) In C++, how would you calculate the absolute value of (-19 + 4 + 10)?
  <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

5.	(2 pts) In C++, how would you generate a random number between 0 and 100?
  <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

6.	(2 pts) In C++, how would you generate a random number between 5 and 15?
  <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

7.	(4 pts) List at least 8 pre-defined functions in C++ that come from the cmath library.
  <div style="margin-bottom:5em"></div>

8.	(4 pts) Look up cstdlib, which is another popular C++ library. What seems to be the biggest difference between cstdlib and cmath?

  <div class="pagebreak"></div>

9.	(6 pts) Write out a short program that simulates the tossing of 2 dice. When run, the program will print out 2 numbers representing 2 randomly thrown dice and then quits. Are the 2 numbers always different every time the program is run?
  <div style="margin-bottom:12em"></div>

10.	(6 pts) The infinite series: s = 1 + (2/3) + (4/9) + (8/27) + .... is a geometric series that converges to a whole rational number (i.e. like 2 or 3 or 4). Below is an unfinished C++ program that will calculate s to the kth position (so, for example, if k = 1, then s = 1 + (2/3) = 1.666...). Fill in the missing code:
  <div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>

  <div markdown="1">
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    double s(0.0);
    int k(0);
    cout << "Enter k: ";
    cin >> k;
    for (____________________________________________________) { 
    
        s = ____________________________________________________; }
        
    cout << "Series converges to: " << s << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
  </div>

11.	(8 pts) Compile and run the above completed program. What is the value of s if k = 5? if k = 20? What whole rational number does s look like it's approaching? What is the smallest value of k for s to be shown by the program as exactly equal to that whole number?

</ol>
