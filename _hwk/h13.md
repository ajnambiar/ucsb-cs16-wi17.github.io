Reading: Read Chapter 8 and the lecture notes.    If you do not have a copy of the textbook yet, there is one on reserve at the library under "COMP000-STAFF - Permanent Reserve".

<b>PLEASE MARK YOUR HOMEWORK CLEARLY, REGARDLESS OF IF YOU WRITE IT OUT IN INK OR PENCIL! FOR BEST RESULTS, SAVE THIS PAGE AS A PDF, THEN PRINT THE PDF.</b>

1.(4 pts) Name 4 reasons why breaking up a program into multiple files can be advantageous.
<div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

2.(2 pts) How are ordinary arrays of characters and c-strings similar and how are they dissimilar?
<div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

3.(4 pts) What are two (2) things that are wrong with this use of a c-string (ignore why someone would write this code, focus on logic/syntax errors)?

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
char s1[5] = "abcd", s2[5] = "efgh";
for (int i = 0; i <= 5; i++)
	s1[i] = 'v';
if (s1 != s2) s1 = "xyz";
```
</div>
<div class="pagebreak"></div>

4.(4 pts) What is the output of the following code?

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
char s1[4] = "abc", s2[4] = "ABC";
if (strcmp(s1, s2)) cout << "Yo!";
else cout << "Hey!";
```
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

5.(8 pts) Given the code shown below, what happens in each of these cases?

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
string line;
cin.ignore(10,'x') >> line;
cout << line << endl;
```

a) If the user enters: abc def ghijk (note the 2 space characters)
<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>
b) If the user enters: abcx123
<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>
c) If the user enters: abcxxyz
<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>
d) If the user enters: abcx123 456 (note the space character)
<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

6.(8 pts) The following code takes in a string input from the user and performs an integer multiplication, as seen in the example run here. Note that the input string will contain the asterix character (i.e. *):

```
Enter 2 integer numbers to be multiplied, like this: num1*num2: 15*3
The answer is: 45
```

Complete the missing code below that performs this task (it can be done in 2 lines, but you can use more if you like).

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
string s; int k(0);
cout << "Enter 2 integer numbers to be multiplied, like this: num1*num2: "; 
cin >> s; 




cout << "The answer is: " << k << endl;
```
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:12em"></div>

7.(10 pts) Write a function called `swapFrontBack` that takes as input a vector of integers. The function should swap the first element in the vector with the last element in the vector. The function should check if the vector is empty to prevent errors.
Attach your answer to this homework. Please do not use more than a single side of a page.
