<b>PLEASE MARK YOUR HOMEWORK CLEARLY, REGARDLESS OF IF YOU WRITE IT OUT IN INK OR PENCIL! FOR BEST RESULTS, SAVE THIS PAGE AS A PDF, THEN PRINT THE PDF.</b>

1.(4 pts) Name 4 reasons why breaking up a program into multiple files can be advantageous.
<div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

2.(2 pts) How are ordinary arrays of characters and c-strings similar and how are they dissimilar?
<div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

3.(4 pts) What are two (2) things that are wrong with this use of a c-string (ignore why someone would write this code, focus on logic/syntax errors)?

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
char s1[5] = "abcd", s2[5] = "efgh";
for (int i = 0; i <= 5; i++)
	s1[i] = 'v';
if (s1 != s2) s1 = "xyz";
```
</div>
<div class="pagebreak"></div>

4.(4 pts) What is the output of the following code?

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
char s1[4] = "abc", s2[4] = "ABC";
if (strcmp(s1, s2)) cout << "Yo!";
else cout << "Hey!";
```
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

5.(8 pts) Given the code shown below, what happens in each of these cases?

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
string line;
cin.ignore(10,'x') >> line;
cout << line << endl;
```

a) If the user enters: abc def ghijk (note the 2 space characters)
<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>
b) If the user enters: abcx123
<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>
c) If the user enters: abcxxyz
<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>
d) If the user enters: abcx123 456 (note the space character)
<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

6.(8 pts) The following code takes in a string input from the user and performs an integer multiplication, as seen in the example run here. Note that the input string will contain the asterix character (i.e. *):

```
Enter 2 integer numbers to be multiplied, like this: num1*num2: 15*3
The answer is: 45
```

Complete the missing code below that performs this task (it can be done in 2 lines, but you can use more if you like).

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
string s; int k(0);
cout << "Enter 2 integer numbers to be multiplied, like this: num1*num2: "; 
cin >> s; 




cout << "The answer is: " << k << endl;
```
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:12em"></div>

7.(10 pts) Write a function called `swapFrontBack` that takes as input a vector of integers. The function should swap the first element in the vector with the last element in the vector. The function should check if the vector is empty to prevent errors.
Attach your answer to this homework. Please do not use more than a single side of a page.


Chapter 14

1.(2 pts) Name 2 useful data structures that utilize pointers in programming.
<div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

2.(2 pts) How does a recursive function know when to stop recursing?
<div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

3.(3 pts) What is a LIFO scheme and how does it relate to stacks?
<div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

4.(3 pts) What is stack overflow?

<div class="pagebreak"></div>

<div markdown="1">
5.(15 pts) Copy the binary search function found at this URL:
**http://cs.ucsb.edu/~zmatni/cs16/hw15/binarySearch.cpp**

It has a few mistakes: fix them and get the program to work correctly. I recommend you do this by examining the code, compiling it, see what errors come up, then edit the code, and repeat the process until you have it working.
Do NOT turn in the completed, fixed program. Instead write out in bullet points in the space below, EVERYTHING you had to fix to get the program working.
<div style="margin-bottom:22em"></div>

6.(15 pts) Write a recursive function program to find the *n*th element in the following arithmetic numerical sequence: **3, 11, 27, 59, 123, ...**

Hint: You first have to figure out what is the recursive pattern. You also have to identify the base case. If you cannot write out the program in the space provided below, then print out the program on a separate sheet of paper and attach that to this homework. Please do not use more than 1 page, one sided.

Some correct example outputs would look like this (there is no repeating loop - these are 2 separate runs):

```
Which element of the sequence would you like to know?
4
Element number 4 in the sequence is 59.


Which element of the sequence would you like to know?
7
Element number 7 in the sequence is 507.
```

"Chapter 9"

1.(3 pts) What is the freestore (also known as the heap) used for?
<div style="margin-bottom:6em"></div>

2.(2 pts) What operator returns unused memory to the freestore (heap)?
<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

3.(2 pts) What C++ unary operator is the "de-referencing" operator?
<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>
 
4.(2 pts) What C++ unary operator is the "address-of" operator?
<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>
 
5.(9 pts) Consider the following code:

`int a=3, b=5, *p=&a, *p2;`

We can draw a diagram that shows the effect of this code in memory, like this.

<img src="pointerDiagramExample.png" width="250" alt="pointerdiagram" />

Note that we are showing the contents of a and b, and we are showing where p1 and p2 point. Since p2 is uninitialized, we show it pointing to a question mark (?). 
If a regular int variable were uninitialized, we would show a question mark (?) inside the box for the variable.
Your job is to draw similar diagrams for the code below (see next page). Please do not be messy and make your diagram very clear and readable.

<div class="pagebreak"></div>
<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int a=6, b=7, *p1=&b, *p2=&a;
p1 = p2;
*p1 = 8;
p2 = &b;


```
</div>

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int a=2, b, *p1=&b, *p2=&a, *p3;
p3 = p2;
*p1 = 8;
p2 = p1;
p1 = p3;
*p2 = 4;
```
</div>

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int a=2, b=3, *p1, *p2;
p2 = &a;
p1 = &b;
*p1 = *p1 + *p2;

```
</div>


6.(8 pts) What will be the output of this program?

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int *pc, c;
    
    c = 5;
    cout << "Address of c (&c): " << &c << endl;
    cout << "Value of c (c): " << c << endl << endl;

    pc = &c;    
    cout << "Address that pointer pc holds (pc): "<< pc << endl;
    cout << "Content of the address pointer pc holds (*pc): " << *pc << endl << endl;
    
    c = 11;    
    cout << "Address pointer pc holds (pc): " << pc << endl;
    cout << "Content of the address pointer pc holds (*pc): " << *pc << endl << endl;

    *pc = 2; 
    cout << "Address of c (&c): " << &c << endl;
    cout << "Value of c (c): " << c << endl << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
</div>

7.Write a program (8 pts) that introduces int variables x and y and int* pointer variables p and q.  Set x to 2, y to 8, p to the address of x, and q to the address of y. Then print the following information:

(a) The address of x and the value of x. (1 pt)

(b) The value of p and the value of *p. (1 pt)

(c) The address of y and the value of y. (1 pt)

(d) The value of q and the value of *q. (1 pt)

(e) The address of p (not its contents!). (1 pt)

(f) The address of q (not its contents!). (1 pt)

Print the program and the outputs of the program on a separate sheet of paper and attach that to this homework. Please do not use more than 1 page (two sided is ok, but one sided is preferred).
