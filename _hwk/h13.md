Read Chapter 8 and the lecture notes. If you do not have a copy of the textbook yet, there is one on reserve at the library under "COMP000-STAFF - Permanent Reserve".

<b>PLEASE MARK YOUR HOMEWORK CLEARLY, REGARDLESS OF IF YOU WRITE IT OUT IN INK OR PENCIL! FOR BEST RESULTS, SAVE THIS PAGE AS A PDF, THEN PRINT THE PDF.</b>

1.(2 pts) How are ordinary arrays of characters and c-strings similar and how are they dissimilar?
<div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

2.(4 pts) What are two (2) things that are wrong with this use of a c-string (ignore why someone would write this code, focus on logic/syntax errors)?

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
char s1[5] = "abcd", s2[5] = "efgh";
for (int i = 0; i <= 5; i++)
	s1[i] = 'v';
if (s1 != s2) s1 = "xyz";
```
</div>


3.(4 pts) What is the output of the following code?

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
char s1[4] = "abc", s2[4] = "ABC";
if (strcmp(s1, s2)) cout << "Yo!";
else cout << "Hey!";
```
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>
<div class="pagebreak"></div>
4.(8 pts) The following code takes in a string input from the user and performs an integer multiplication, as seen in the example run here. Note that the input string will contain the asterix character (i.e. *):

```
Enter 2 integer numbers to be multiplied, like this: num1*num2: 15*3
The answer is: 45
```

Complete the missing code below that performs this task (it can be done in 2 lines, but you can use more if you like).

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
string s; int k(0);
cout << "Enter 2 integer numbers to be multiplied, like this: num1*num2: "; 
cin >> s; 




cout << "The answer is: " << k << endl;
```
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:12em"></div>

5.(10 pts) Show the output produced when the following code (entire program not shown) is executed. You are encouraged to also try to compile this in a program to verify your results.

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
    string name = "Jeffery Tambor";

    cout << "NAME = " + name << endl;
    cout << name.length() << endl;

    name.erase(8, 6);
    cout << name << endl;
    name.append("Dean WD Morgan");
    cout << name << endl;

    name.insert(22, "@TWD");
    cout << name << endl;
    name.replace(23, 3, "The WD");
    cout << name << endl;

    cout << name.find("WD") << endl;
    cout << name.rfind("WD") << endl;
    cout << name.rfind("fery") << endl;

    for (int i = name.length(); i > 20; i--)
        cout << name[i-1];
    cout << endl;
```
</div>




Chapter 14

1.(2 pts) Name 2 useful data structures that utilize pointers in programming.
<div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

2.(2 pts) How does a recursive function know when to stop recursing?
<div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

3.(3 pts) What is a LIFO scheme and how does it relate to stacks?
<div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

4.(3 pts) What is stack overflow?

<div class="pagebreak"></div>

<div markdown="1">
5.(15 pts) Copy the binary search function found at this URL:
**http://cs.ucsb.edu/~zmatni/cs16/hw15/binarySearch.cpp**

It has a few mistakes: fix them and get the program to work correctly. I recommend you do this by examining the code, compiling it, see what errors come up, then edit the code, and repeat the process until you have it working.
Do NOT turn in the completed, fixed program. Instead write out in bullet points in the space below, EVERYTHING you had to fix to get the program working.
<div style="margin-bottom:22em"></div>

6.(15 pts) Write a recursive function program to find the *n*th element in the following arithmetic numerical sequence: **3, 11, 27, 59, 123, ...**

Hint: You first have to figure out what is the recursive pattern. You also have to identify the base case. If you cannot write out the program in the space provided below, then print out the program on a separate sheet of paper and attach that to this homework. Please do not use more than 1 page, one sided.

Some correct example outputs would look like this (there is no repeating loop - these are 2 separate runs):

```
Which element of the sequence would you like to know?
4
Element number 4 in the sequence is 59.


Which element of the sequence would you like to know?
7
Element number 7 in the sequence is 507.
```

</div>
