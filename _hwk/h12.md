Read Chapter 7.1 and 7.2 (If you do not have a copy of the textbook yet, there is one on reserve at the library under "COMP000-STAFF - Permanent Reserve"). 

<b>PLEASE MARK YOUR HOMEWORK CLEARLY, REGARDLESS OF IF YOU WRITE IT OUT IN INK OR PENCIL!<br/>
FOR BEST RESULTS, PRINT THIS PAGE AS A PDF, THEN PRINT THE PDF</b>

1.(5 pts) What is the output of the following code? If there's an error that will not allow an output, point it out.

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int arr[5];
for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
	if (i < 3) arr[i] = 'a';
	else arr[i] = 'z';
	cout << arr[i] << endl;  }
```
</div>

2.(5 pts) What is the output of the following code? If there's an error that will not allow an output, point it out.

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int arr[7] = {5};
for (int i = 0; i < 7; i++)
	cout << arr[i] + i << endl; 
```
</div>

3.(5 pts) What is the output of the following code? If there's an error that will not allow an output, point it out.

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int codes[] = {44, 66, 83, 973, -977};
for (int count : codes) {
	if ( (count/2) < 50 )
		cout << count << endl;
	else cout << "invalid" << endl; }
```
</div>

4.(10 pts) Using the same formula from Lab 6, write a program that finds the standard deviation of the contents of this array of doubles:<br/><b>nums[7] = {1.0, 3.2, 4.0, 4.0, 5.5, 9.0, 9.1}</b>.

Give your answer in fixed point notation with 4 places after the decimal point showing. Print out your program and hand it in with this homework.
<div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>

5.(15 pts) Write a program that takes 10 integer inputs from the user via keyboard and puts them in one array called `myNums[]`, then prints them back out one at a time in this format: `Number 1: 55`, and finally, computes the sum of these numbers and displays that in this format: `Total sum: 922`.

<b>Condition:</b> The printing of the numbers and the calculation/printing of the sum MUST BE done with 2 functions, respectively, in which you pass the entire `myNums` array. Print out your program and hand it in with this homework.
