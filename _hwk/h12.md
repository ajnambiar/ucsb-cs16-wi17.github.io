Read these two handouts one that reviews the basic concepts of creating linked-lists and iterating through them [http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/103/LinkedListBasics.pdf](http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/103/LinkedListBasics.pdf), the other covers more advanced problems involving linked lists [http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/105/LinkedListProblems.pdf](http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/105/LinkedListProblems.pdf). The first handout should mostly be review from the book section 13.1 (If you do not have a copy of the textbook yet, there is one on reserve at the library under "COMP000-STAFF - Permanent Reserve").
