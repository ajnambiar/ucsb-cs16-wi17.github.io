Read Chapter 3.1 - 3.3 (If you do not have a copy of the textbook yet, there is one on reserve at the library under "COMP000-STAFF - Permanent Reserve").

<b>PLEASE MARK YOUR HOMEWORK CLEARLY, REGARDLESS OF IF YOU WRITE IT OUT IN INK OR PENCIL!</b>

<ol markdown="1">
1.	(2 pts) What is a runtime error in C++?
  <div style="margin-bottom:3em"></div>

2.	(6 pts) Use precedence rules to re-write the following expressions:
  <div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>
	x / 4 - 3 == 1 && 6 * x + y > 0
  <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>
	a / b * b < 0.5 || --flag >= 0
  <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>
	z * m + n / v >= 5 && b + c - d != 0 || f < g
  <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

3.	(4 pts) What is the output of the following statements?
  <div markdown="1">
```
int p = 5;
while (--p > 0)
     cout << p << " ";
```
  </div>
  <div style="margin-bottom:5em"></div>

4.	(4 pts) What is the output of the following statements?
  <div markdown="1">
```
int s = 1;
do
     cout << s << " ";
while (s++ <= 5);
```
  </div>
  <div style="margin-bottom:5em"></div>
  <div class="pagebreak"></div>

5.	(4 pts) Same question as above, but the last statement now reads:

  <div markdown="1">
```
while (++s <= 5);
```
  </div>
  <div style="margin-bottom:5em"></div>

6.	(10 pts) Write a block of statements (like a function, but you don't have to write it like a function) that take three arguments of type int and returns true if the arguments are in ascending order; otherwise, it returns false. You can use any type of C++ statement types that we've gone over in class so far to accomplish this goal.
	<div style="margin-bottom:30em"></div>

7.	(10 pts) Using a switch statement, re-write the program from the previous homework 4, question 7. As a reminder, your program first asks for the user's name, then asks the user to pick a shape to find the area to: a rectangle, a triangle, a trapezoid, or a circle. Based on the user's choice, the program then gets the pertinent parameters from user input, then it calculates the area of the shape, and finally, it reports the answer back to the user.
	<div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>
	Employ the same methods with this exercise as you did the homework 4, question 7 one: plan it, write it, compile and test it, and then finally, print this out separately and hand it in with this homework (just like what you did for homework 4).
	<div style="margin-bottom:0em"></div>
	<b>AGAIN, PLEASE REMEMBER TO PUT YOUR FULL NAME AND ID# ON THIS SHEET!</b>
