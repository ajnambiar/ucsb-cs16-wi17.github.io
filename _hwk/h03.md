Read Chapter 2, sections 2.3 - 2.5 (If you don't have a copy of the textbook yet, there is one on reserve at the library under "COMP000-STAFF - Permanent Reserve").

<ol markdown="1">

1.	(4 pts) Using an example explain what a "type mismatch" is? How do compilers handle C++ statements that have a type mismatch?

  <div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

2.	(4 pts) What does the keyword 'auto' do for the programmer in the C++11 declaration: 
<div markdown="1"> 
  `auto x = 2.73;`
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

3. (4 pts) Write an if-else statement that outputs the string "Grade is A" if the variable `score` is between 93 and 95 (both limits included). Otherwise the if-else statement should output "Grade is not A" ?
<div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>
 
<div class="pagebreak"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

4.	(4 pts) The program below intends to do the following: Repeatedly prompt the user to input an integer number. When the user no longer wants to continue entering numbers, output the sum of all the positive numbers entered by the user followed by the sum of all the negative numbers entered by the user. However, this program has bugs. Circle all the bugs in the program and provide corrections in the space to the right.

<div markdown="1">
```
#include <iostream>

int main(){

    int a , sumPositive, sumNegative;

    string promptContinue ="\nTo continue enter Y/y\n", promptNum = "\nEnter a number: ";

    char response;

    while (response = 'y'||`Y') {

       cout << promptNum;

       cin >> a;

       if(a) 
          sumPositive+=a; 

       else
          sumNegative+=a;

       cout<< promptContinue;

       

    } 

    cout<< "Sum of all the positive numbers is: "<< sumPositive<<endl;

    cout<< "Sum of all the negative numbers is: "<< sumNegative<<endl;

    return 0; 
}
```
</div>

<div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>

5.	(4 pts) What is the resulting output display from the following C++ statements? AND EXPLAIN WHY.
    <div style="margin-bottom:0.5em"></div>

<div markdown="1">

```
int x=20, y=5;

bool v, w;

v = (x != y);

w = ((x/=y) == 4);

cout << x << " " <<y << " "<< v << " "<< w << endl;

```
