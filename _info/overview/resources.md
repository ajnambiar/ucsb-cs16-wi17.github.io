# Required Resources<a name="resources"></a>

* Textbook: Problem Solving with C++, Walter Savitch, Edition 9. Available for purchase at the UCSB book store

* Peer Instruction : iClickers: The course lectures will follow a Peer Instruction format, a teaching model which places stronger emphasis on classroom discussion and student interaction. As part of this you will need to own an iClicker register it on the [Gauchospace](https://gauchospace.ucsb.edu/courses/course/view.php?id=1524)). Be sure to register your clicker by the end of the first week.

# Exam Resources

You can find examples of previous quarter's  exams at the following links.

But BEWARE---offerings of CS16 may vary in terms of their exact pace, and placement of exams. So these exams are a guide to the style of my exams, but NOT necessarily for specific content.

In addition, these exams from prior to F14 used the C programming language rather than C++, and went at a much slower pace, so treat them with even more skepticism.
