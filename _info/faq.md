# Frequently Asked Questions

<h2 class="pagebreak">Other frequently asked questions</h2>
<h3 ><em>Do we need to bring our textbook to lecture? To lab?</em></h3>
<p> It is generally not necessary to bring the textbook to <em>lectures</em> for CS16. It may be helpful to bring the book to lab though, as it may be a useful reference for working on programming assignments.</p>
<p>Though I say it is not necessary to bring your textbook to lecture, here are two specific cases, though, where it might be helpful:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you want to ask a question about something specific from the reading, and you would like to have the textbook to refer to.</li>
  <li>If you happen to have some &quot;unscheduled time&quot; immediately after the lecture ends at 3:15, and you can take that time to do the homework for the next day's class.   You'll get the assignment in class, and if you have your textbook with you, then right after class you can start on it right away and get it done.  This is the best time to work on it, while the topic of CS16 is fresh in your mind---and starting early gives you more chance to ask me and the TAs questions in case you are not sure about something.</li>
  <li>I offer extra credit to the first person to report typos in the assigned readings from the book, or the homework assignments themselves.  Thus, starting earlier gives you a better chance to be the first one to report the typo. There is a special forum on Gauchospace for reporting typos—the time it is first reported there is what counts for extra credit (reporting it by email or in person or in class is <em>nice</em>, but does <em>not</em> earn the extra credit.)</li>
  </ul>
<p >Do we need to bring laptops to class? </p>
<p >You do not <em>need</em> to bring a laptop to class. </p>
<h3 >Are we permitted to use laptops during lecture?</h3>
<p >Some instructors are bothered by students having laptops in class—and I can definitely understand this, especially in cases where students are not actually using the laptops to take notes, or try out code, but instead to read email or Facebook, play games, etc. That latter use can be a real distraction to others sitting behind that student, not to mention the distraction to the laptop user herself/himself.</p>
<p >I recognize the value that having a laptop in class can offer to the student that is using it for legitimate purposes related to the class, so I'm not going to start the quarter with a no-laptops policy. However, if I find that this isn't working out, I reserve the right to change the policy and implement a  ban on laptops in lecture (where the only exception would be someone with a medically certified disability that needs the laptop for ADA-compliance.)</p>
<p >So, you don't want to be &quot;that guy&quot; or &quot;that gal&quot; that spoils it for everyone else. If you use a laptop, use it for legit purposes during class time.</p>
<h3 >What about laptops in lab?</h3>
<p >Sometimes students want to use their laptops in lab instead of using the Linux computers provided. I would like to strongly discourage this for a variety of reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>learning to use the Linux environment is one of the learning objectives of the course—that environment is used in later CS courses (CS24,CS32,CS48,CS56, and almost every upper division programming course.)</li>
  <li>using the Linux environment helps facilitate the whole &quot;pair programming&quot; thing—if it's &quot;your&quot; computer, your pair partner is likely to feel less comfortable than you. Using the shared machines &quot;levels the playing field&quot;.</li>
  </ul>
<p>This isn't an absolute prohibition. If the Linux machines are having software or hardware problems, or there is a problem with your account—these things happen rarely, but they do happen sometimes—then, sure, go ahead and use the laptop during lab. But otherwise, please stick with the machines provided.</p>
<h3>Do we need to download anything to our laptops or computers at home/in the dorm?</h3>
<p>If you are using Windows, you definitely will want to download two programs: PuTTY and XMing. These programs allow you to access the Linux environment on the CoE computers from your Windows machine. (Mac and Linux users usually have tools to do that already installed as part of the operating system called &quot;ssh&quot; and &quot;X11&quot;.)</p>
