# Topics

By the end of this lecture students should have everything they need to make significant progress with the upcoming lab.

## C++ variables and datatypes
* Unlike Python, you MUST "declare" variables on first appearance in any C++ program. We'll discuss what this means.
* Scope and lifetime of variables
* Uninitialized variables in C++
* We will look at three specific datatypes: char, int and string

## Simple flow control structurs
* If else statements are DIFFERENT in C++ than in Python. We'll discuss.
* For and while loops are DIFFERENT in C++ than in Python. We'll discuss.

## File I/O basics
* Examining text files using 1) an editor 2) cat command 3) hexdump 
* Opening a file: open()
* Reading a line from a file: getline()
* Reading until the end of file is reached
* Detecting failures

## Github Basics
* Creating a repository on github
* Adding a new file to the repository using github's webinterface
* Gentle intro to github command line: cloning a repo to a local machine, syncing repos with git add, commit and push

We will learn all the above concepts by writing, compiling and executing an example program in C++
