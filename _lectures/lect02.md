# Topics

By the end of this lecture students should have everything they need to make significant progress with the upcoming lab.

## C++ variables and programs in memory
* Unlike Python, you MUST "declare" variables on first appearance in any C++ program. We'll discuss what this means.
* The data type of a variable determines a number of things about how the variable is stored in memory
* Scope and lifetime of variables
* Our model of memory, units of memory


## C++ conditionals
* For loops are DIFFERENT in C++ than in Python. We'll discuss.
* If else and while loops are DIFFERENT in C++ than in Python. We'll discuss.

## Test driven development
* Explore the TDD paradigm 
* Coding example: Fizzbuzz in C++

## Github Basics
* Creating a repository on github
* Adding a new file to the repository
* Gentle intro to github command line: cloning a repo to a local machine, syncing repos with git add, commit and push
