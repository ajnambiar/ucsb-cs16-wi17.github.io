# Topics

## How to evaluate C++ expressions

* Operator precedence
* Operator associativity
* Order of evaluation

## Data and number representation 

* binary, hex, decimal 
* Conversion between different representations
* Representing characters: ASCII
* The data type of a variable determines its representation in memory AND the number of bits used to store each variable
