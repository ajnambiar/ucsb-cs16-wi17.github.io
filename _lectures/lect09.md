# Topics
[https://github.com/ucsb-cs16-wi17/lecture-02-09](https://github.com/ucsb-cs16-wi17/lecture-02-09)

## Pointers
* Pointer declaration - difference/similarities with declaring basic types
* Accessing variables "indirectly" via pointers
* The address and indirection operators: "&" and "*"
* Pointers and arrays

## Layout of C++ programs in memory
* First order model of memory
* Program layout: text, data, bss, stack and heap
* Connections with the stored program model

## Under the hood of function calls
* Function calls use the run-time stack, we'll see how and why that's important
* Review of pass by value
* Passing parameters to functions by value 

## Complex declarions in C++
* Right left rule

## C++ References
* Creating aliases with references
* Differences between references and pointers
* Constant pointers and references, when and why to use them
