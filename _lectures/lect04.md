# Topics
 
## Data and number representation 
* binary, hex, decimal 
* Representing characters: ASCII
* Tools to examine data in files: hexdump
* The data type of a variable determines its representation in memory AND the number of bits used to store each variable
* passing parameters to main 

## Hardware abstractions
* The modern digital computer - stored program model and the Von Neumann architecture, why are we talking about architecture?
* The hardware/software interface
 
## Under the hood of program compilation and execution
* From high-level programs to machine code
* A peek into assembly code
* Making it real: Getting the compiler to show assembly code
* Creating object files and linking programs with g++

## Layout of C++ programs in memory
* First order model of memory
* Program layout: text, data, bss, stack and heap
* Connections with the stored program model

## Under the hood of function calls
* Function calls use the run-time stack, we'll see how and why that's important
* Review of pass by value
* Passing parameters to functions by value
* Passing parameters to main
