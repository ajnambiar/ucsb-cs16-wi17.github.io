# Topics
This lecture and many of the coming lectures require that we understand how our programs interact with computer memory. This is not required to understanding some of the programming constructs like arrays and pointers but is crucial for reasoning about weird program behavior and debugging. So, we will begin with a model of computer memory and then delve into C++ arrays and pointers

## C++ arrays
* C/C++ arrays are like lists in Python and Arrays in Java. We will discuss the differences between these.
* Declaring and initializing arrays in C++
* Tracing code involving arrays
* Strings: null terminated char arrays
* How to create a list of names with arrays
* Array pitfalls: out of bound array access


## C++ Pointers 

* Pointer declaration - difference/similarities with declaring basic types
* Accessing variables "indirectly" via pointers
* The address and indirection operators: "&" and "*"


## Under the hood of program compilation and execution
* From high-level programs to machine code
* Creating object files and linking programs with g++
* Makefiles


## Complex declarions in C++
* Right left rule
