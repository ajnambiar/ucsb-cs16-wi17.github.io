# Topics


## Under the hood of program compilation and execution
* From high-level programs to machine code
* Creating object files and linking programs with g++
* Makefiles



## Layout of C++ programs in memory
* First order model of memory
* Program layout: text, data, bss, stack and heap
* Connections with the stored program model

## Under the hood of function calls
* Function calls use the run-time stack, we'll see how and why that's important
* Review of pass by value
* Passing parameters to functions by value


## C++ Pointers 
* Review model of computer memory
* Pointer declaration - difference/similarities with declaring basic types
* Accessing variables "indirectly" via pointers
* The address and indirection operators: "&" and "*"
* Pointer arithmetic
* Pointer pitfalls

## C++ References
* Creating aliases with references
* Differences between references and pointers
* Constant pointers and references, when and why to use them

## C++ arrays
* C/C++ arrays are like lists in Python and Arrays in Java. We will discuss the differences between these.
* Strings: null terminated char arrays
* How to create a list of names with arrays
* Similarities and differences between arrays and pointers
* Array pitfalls: out of bound array access


## Complex declarions in C++
* Right left rule
