# Topics

## More control flow and boolean expressions
* Nested and multi-way if-else 
* For loops
* Nested loops (self-learn)  
* We will practice both these concepts by playing and coding a game called "Fizzbuzz" in class



## File I/O basics
* Examining text files using 1) an editor 2) cat command 
* Opening a file: open()
