## Instructions for the exam (please note that instructions are different from midterm 1)

* You may NOT bring any notes with you. Instead we ask that you collaborate with your classmates and the tutors before the class to develop a commmon set of notes covering all of the midterm topics via an online collaborative document

* Creating the collaborative notes document: Please add information that you would have liked to have on the exam to this collaborative document: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-_Yhl8bfTt8NrpIo0sJ-3Qrb4zmzQuwtvvclbcx2EAg/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-_Yhl8bfTt8NrpIo0sJ-3Qrb4zmzQuwtvvclbcx2EAg/edit?usp=sharing). A subset of the information will be made available to you on the exam as exam notes.

* I will select information from the collaborative document as notes that will be given out in the exam. These notes will NOT include solutions to programming assignments from labs or HWs. I will provide everyone with the same set of notes on the exam. You will also have access to the full set of notes from the collaborative document and the notes you expect to see on the exam, prior to the exam.  

* No calculators or phones are allowed in the exam 
* You may not bring ANY notes or books 
* There are no makeups for this exam 
* You must write your name on every single sheet of paper including your notes
* We will provide you with scratch paper
* We will provide you the table of operator precedence
* The format of the exam will be the same as midterm 1

## Post exam information 

The exam paper and solution will be posted after the midterm.



## Reference material
You are expected to know the material from the following lectures, labs and homeworks:

* [Lecture 1](https://ucsb-cs16-wi17.github.io/lectures/lect01/) (2017-01-10) to [lecture 14](https://ucsb-cs16-wi17.github.io/lectures/lect14/) (2017-02-28), with the exception of file IO, operator precedence (lectures 4 and 5), makefiles and tdd. You will be tested on these topics on the final exam. The main emphasis will be on topics covered after midterm 1 ([lecture 8](https://ucsb-cs16-wi17.github.io/lectures/lect08/) to [lecture 14](https://ucsb-cs16-wi17.github.io/lectures/lect14/)), with the exception of makefiles and tdd. In other words, you will be primarily tested on pointers, references, arrays, structs, pointers to basic or struct type, and linked lists. A full list is provided later in this document.

* Homework 1 to 11, with emphasis on hw 7 to 11
* Labs 3 to 6 (including both labs)

## Practice problems

In addition to all the homeworks, labs and lectures, you may use the problems in the following document to practice:


## Past exams
You may also refer to all the past exams. Please note that some questions on these exams may refer to labs that you have not completed so far. You will only be asked questions related to the labs you have completed. The past exams should however provide some information on the expected difficulty and approximate format of the exam. Please note that there may be differences in content as well.

* [Spring'10](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/cs16/10S/exams/)
* [Winter'10](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/cs16/10W/exams/)
* [Fall'09](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/cs16/09F/exams)

## Midterm Study Guide

* Arrays: declaration, initialization, iteration through array using for loops [lec 8](/lectures/lect08/), 
* Passing arrays to functions [lec 9](/lectures/lect09/), [lec11](/lectures/lect11/)





1. What is the freestore (also known as the heap) used for?
<div style="margin-bottom:6em"></div>

2. What operator returns unused memory to the freestore (heap)?
<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

3. What C++ unary operator is the "de-referencing" operator?
<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>
 
4.What C++ unary operator is the "address-of" operator?
<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>
 
5.Consider the following code:

`int a=3, b=5, *p=&a, *p2;`

We can draw a diagram that shows the effect of this code in memory, like this.

<img src="pointerDiagramExample.png" width="250" alt="pointerdiagram" />

Note that we are showing the contents of a and b, and we are showing where p1 and p2 point. Since p2 is uninitialized, we show it pointing to a question mark (?). 
If a regular int variable were uninitialized, we would show a question mark (?) inside the box for the variable.
Your job is to draw similar diagrams for the code below (see next page). Please do not be messy and make your diagram very clear and readable.

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int a=6, b=7, *p1=&b, *p2=&a;
p1 = p2;
*p1 = 8;
p2 = &b;


```
</div>

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int a=2, b, *p1=&b, *p2=&a, *p3;
p3 = p2;
*p1 = 8;
p2 = p1;
p1 = p3;
*p2 = 4;
```
</div>

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int a=2, b=3, *p1, *p2;
p2 = &a;
p1 = &b;
*p1 = *p1 + *p2;

```
</div>


6.What will be the output of this program?

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int *pc, c;
    
    c = 5;
    cout << "Address of c (&c): " << &c << endl;
    cout << "Value of c (c): " << c << endl << endl;

    pc = &c;    
    cout << "Address that pointer pc holds (pc): "<< pc << endl;
    cout << "Content of the address pointer pc holds (*pc): " << *pc << endl << endl;
    
    c = 11;    
    cout << "Address pointer pc holds (pc): " << pc << endl;
    cout << "Content of the address pointer pc holds (*pc): " << *pc << endl << endl;

    *pc = 2; 
    cout << "Address of c (&c): " << &c << endl;
    cout << "Value of c (c): " << c << endl << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
</div>

7. Write a program  that introduces int variables x and y and int* pointer variables p and q.  Set x to 2, y to 8, p to the address of x, and q to the address of y. Then print the following information:

(a) The address of x and the value of x. (1 pt)

(b) The value of p and the value of *p. (1 pt)

(c) The address of y and the value of y. (1 pt)

(d) The value of q and the value of *q. (1 pt)

(e) The address of p (not its contents!). (1 pt)

(f) The address of q (not its contents!). (1 pt)

Print the program and the outputs of the program on a separate sheet of paper and attach that to this homework. Please do not use more than 1 page (two sided is ok, but one sided is preferred).
